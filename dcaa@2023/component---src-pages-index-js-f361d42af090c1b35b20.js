Years of research in this area have developed a wealth of theories, algorithms, and open-source systems for a variety of learning tasks. State-of-the-art graph learning models have been widely deployed in various real-world applications, often delivering superior empirical performance in answering what/who questions. For example, what are the most relevant web pages with respect to a user query? Who can be grouped into the same community? What items should we recommend to best-fit user preferences? Despite the prosperous development of high-utility graph learning models, recent studies reveal that learning on graphs is not trustworthy in many aspects. For example, existing methods make decisions in a black-box manner, which hinders the end-users to understand and trust model decisions. Many commonly applied approaches are also found to be vulnerable to malicious attacks, biased against individuals from certain demographic groups, or insecure to information leakage. As such, a fundamental question largely remains nascent: how can we make learning algorithms on graphs trustworthy? To answer this question, it is crucial to propose a paradigm shift, from answering what/who to understanding how/why, e.g., how the ranking of webpages can be manipulated by the malicious link farms; why two seemingly different users are grouped into the same online community; how sensitive the recommendation results are due to the random noises or fake ratings."),n.createElement("div",{className:"mt-5"},n.createElement("ul",{className:"list-disc pl-5"},n.createElement("li",null,"Discovering graph-specific measurements and techniques for trustworthy learning;"),n.createElement("li",null,"Understanding the implications of non-IID graph data on the classic trustworthy machine learning;"),n.createElement("li",null,"Achieving trustworthy learning on graphs at scale;"),n.createElement("li",null,"Accommodating the heterogeneity of graph data;"),n.createElement("li",null,"Dealing with dynamically changing and/or temporal graphs."))),n.createElement("div",{className:"mt-5 leading-8"},"This one-day workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from different backgrounds to answer these research questions and enhance the trustworthiness of learning on graphs.
